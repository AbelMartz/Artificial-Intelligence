# ICOM5015 – Artificial Intelligence Programming Assignments

## Overview
This repository includes programming assignments developed for ICOM5015 Artificial Intelligence at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus. The assignments demonstrate the application of core AI techniques such as agent modeling, local search, performance optimization, and game-playing strategies.

## Assignments

### 1. Python Performance: Native Python vs. NumPy
Performance comparison of Python loops vs. NumPy operations for 1D and 2D arrays. Includes timing analysis and optimization strategies.
- Tools: Python 3, NumPy
- Deliverables: Report and team video presentation
- Focus: Computational efficiency and vectorization

### 2. Intelligent Agents – Exercises 2.11 & 2.14
Exercises based on Russell & Norvig's textbook exploring agent definitions and behavior in various environments.
- Topics: Rational agents, PEAS frameworks
- Deliverables: Python code and explanatory video
- Focus: Agent structure and interaction with environments

### 3. Local Search Algorithms – Exercise 4.4
Application of local search strategies (hill climbing, random restart, simulated annealing) to 8-puzzle and 8-queens problems.
- Metrics: Search cost, success rate
- Tools: Python 3, Matplotlib
- Deliverables: Graphical analysis and observations

### 4. Domino AI Player
Development of an AI agent to play Domino using search or probabilistic techniques. The assignment includes a structured video presentation that parallels the written report.
- Tools: Python 3
- Topics: Game strategy, agent decision-making
- Deliverables: AI implementation and recorded team presentation
- Focus: Adversarial search, stochastic simulation (e.g., Monte Carlo methods)

## Technologies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploration and demos)
